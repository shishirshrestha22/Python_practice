# output is 5

""" this code gives output as 5 because it operates from -3,-2,-1,0,1,2 
and (if i:)stastement  is true for all integer except 0 so"""

#when i = -3 s is 1
#when i = -2 s becomes 2
#when i = -1 s becomes 3
#when i = 0 s remains 3 because if i is false at 0
#when i = 1 s becomes 4
#when i = 2 s becomes 5
#and finally prints 5
